        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p><strong>Standalone Hybrid Renewable Energy System</strong> – Hybrid Renewable energy system (HRES) is increasingly popular due to exhaustion of natural sources. Hybrid energy systems are interconnected with wind power, photovoltaic power, Hydro turbine to generate power to local load and connecting to micro-grids as sustainable, cost-effective and environment friendly alternatives for conventional energy sources that decrease the dependence on fossil fuels .The main aim of this project is to find out the maximum output of standalone HRES with battery storage using Hydro, Wind and Solar energy for a small community, commercial power parks, distribution grid support and power price stabilization. Various renewable energy sources along with energy storage devices and their application are discussed in terms of cost and performance. The different solutions are analyzed and the stand alone HRES configuration is selected. The characteristics of the stand alone HRES are discussed.</p>
